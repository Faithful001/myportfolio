My Tech journey began in late 2018, when I used to mess around with DIY toys and arduinos — turns out trying to program an arduino introduced me into the tech space!

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a start-up, a huge corporation, and a tech community assistant. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Teknology Group   for a variety of clients.

I have used and still use a couple of tools and languages for my development process. I have listed a few of them below (not *really* including frameworks).</p>
